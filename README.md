# My Flutter Portfolio

Hello, I'm Fabian Karaben. Welcome to my portfolio! 

I have more than 15 years of experience as a software developer, the last 5 years building mobile and web applications with Flutter, Firebase and many REST APIs. 

I'm also learning backend development with Go, because I love that language as much as I love Dart. 

In the past I mainly worked as a web developer using JavaScript and even I have worked as a SysAdmin since I like Linux, networks and servers.

Apps in which I have worked the last years:

## Vocabulary 101 - English Vocabulary

https://vocabulary101.com/<br>
https://github.com/vocabulary101/vocabulary101_app

A Flutter app to improve vocabulary of English words, ideal for all people who use the English language on a daily basis.

Built with Flutter, user data was stored in Firebase, and the website was deployed using Cloudflare Pages.

Technologies: Flutter, Firebase.

## whois (Dart/Flutter package)

https://pub.dev/packages/whois<br>

Lightweight and performant WHOIS client supporting hundreds of TLDs.
Programmed in the Dart programming language and compatible for use on all platforms supported by Flutter.

## Uolia - YouTube Video Organizer

https://github.com/sciencehash/uolia_app

This was one of my weekend Flutter projects. It was an app to help people learn with YouTube courses, allowing the student to organize the courses and record progress in each of them and thus be able to continue at another time without losing the thread. Also available on Google Play.

Built with Flutter, user data was stored in Firebase, and the website was deployed using Cloudflare Pages.

Technologies: Flutter, Firebase.

## Duy - URL shortener

This was a project that allowed users to get short URLs and redirect them to wherever they prefer. It also gave the user the possibility of publishing a profile with its tree of links, very useful for example for people with many social networks.
User data was stored in Firebase and redirects were done using the Google Cloud Platform Functions service.

Technologies: Flutter, Firebase, Cloudflare Workers.

## EV Charging Points

This project consisted of an app for the Android platform, which showed charging points for electric cars in a region of India, the client's country. It also calculated the trajectory needed to make a trip through the nearest charging points so that the car never fully discharges its battery.

Built with Flutter and the user data was stored in Firebase.

Technologies: Flutter, Firebase, Google Maps.

## Learning Code for Free

This was an app to view learning content, content stored in Markdown format but adding interactive screens, such as end-of-chapter surveys so the reader can check their understanding of the chapter.

Built with Flutter, user data was stored in Firebase, and the website was deployed using Cloudflare Pages.

Technologies: Flutter, Firebase.
